1. Create the database schema 
    
    ` npx prisma migrate dev --name init `

This command does two things:

    It creates a new SQL migration file for this migration
    It runs the SQL migration file against the database

2. Install and generate Prisma Client
npm install @prisma/client
    npx prisma migrate dev --name ...
